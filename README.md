# Ansible Roles

## Usage

You should configure [roles_path](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_configuration.html#roles-path)
value in your Ansible configuration file so that Ansible can locate
this directory.

## Variables

Some role definitions refer to variables.  You need to supply actual
values for them using such as `host_vars` or `group_vars` files.  See
`README.md` file in each role for further information.
