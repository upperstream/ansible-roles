# Ansible Roles

## Usage

You should configure [roles_path](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_configuration.html#roles-path)
value in your Ansible configuration file so that Ansible can locate
this directory.

## Variables

Some role definitions refer to variables.  You need to supply actual
values for them using such as `host_vars` or `group_vars` files.  See
`README.md` file in each role for further information.

## Note for Arch Linux and descendants

In order for Arch Linux family to use AUR as well as the official
repository, role definitions depend on
[kewlfft.aur](https://github.com/kewlfft/ansible-aur) Ansible
collection with any of AUR helper compatible to `pacman`.  The
`kewlfft.aur` collection needs to be installed on the Ansible
controller, an AUR helper needs to be installed on the target host, and
the helper name needs to be set to the variable
`archlinux_pacman_wrapper`.

The ansible user should be allowed to invoke `sudo pacman` without
a password.  See the _[Create the "aur_builder" user](https://github.com/kewlfft/ansible-aur#create-the-aur_builder-user)_
section of the `kewlfft.aur` document for details.

The [base](base/README.md) role can install any of the following AUR
helper on Arch Linux target hosts by setting `archlinux_pacman_wrapper`
variable:

* [aura](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aura)
* [aurman](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aurman)
* [pacaur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aurman)
* [pakku](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pakku)
* [paru](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/paru)
* [pikaur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pikaur)
* [trizen](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/trizen)
* [yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay),

while `kewlfft.aur.aur` Ansible module supports `yay`, `paru`,
`pacaur`, `trizen`, `pikaur`, and `aurman`.
