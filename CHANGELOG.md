# Changelog

## [Unreleased][]

* Added
  * Add `sound` role for configuring audio playback features
  * [base](base/README.md) Add tasks to bootstrap macOS configuration

## [20250212][]

* Added
  * Add [cuda](cuda/README.md) role to install CUDA on Debian hosts
  * Add [docker_host](docker_host/README.md) role to set up docker host
    on Debian hosts
  * Add support for executing roles on macOS.  This introduces a
    variable `false_for_macos`, which should be set to `false` when
    roles are executed against macOS hosts.  This ensures that package
    installation is performed by a normal user on macOS, where the
    `ansible.builtin.package` module relies on [Homebrew][] for package
    management.
